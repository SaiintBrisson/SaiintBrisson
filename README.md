## Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Luiz (he/him), 17 years old, programming enthusiast and hobbyist photographer.  

### Interests

I've previously fiddled around with lots of languages but my favorite was Java (mainly because of Minecraft), until I met Rust.

Rust has been my main language for the past year or so, it's beautifully designed and well thought. It has enchanted me with its features and versatility. Throughout the last year, I developed a special interest in networks, distributed systems, and performant/reliable services. I am currently studying performant and safe code hygiene. I enjoy solving puzzles, mainly when working with distributed systems.

### Knowledge

* Languages: I'm most familiar with Rust, Java, Kotlin, JavaScript (TypeScript), and Go.
* Databases: I have experience with PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB and Redis.
* Hosting solutions: AWS and GCP.
* Container runtime: Docker, Containerd, Vagrant, and Kubernetes.
* CI/CD: Github Actions, and TravisCI
