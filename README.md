# hey there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Luiz (he/him), 17 years old, programming enthusiast and hobbyist photographer.  

## Interests

Currently learning Rust and enjoying it a lot ðŸ¦€. Using it to mostly build servers (of all kinds), specially using tokio + actix.

My main interests are working with networks and distributed systems. Being a very curious person, I like to understand how fast & reliable services are designed and work, so I spend a lot of time researching and studying everything from scientific papers, articles (_sometimes of dubious quality_), to large open-source codebases. Another passion of mine is to contribute to open-source projects.
