# hey there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Luiz (he/him), 17 years old, programming enthusiast and hobbyist photographer.  

## Interests

I'm learning Rust and enjoying it a lot. 

Throughout the last year, I developed a special interest in networks, distributed systems, and performant/reliable services. I am currently studying performant and safe code hygiene. I enjoy solving puzzles, mainly when working with distributed systems.
